Its Anti-Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing Policy aims to actively prevent risks related to these issues. To comply with the law, financial institutions must verify and record information that identifies each account opener. The company is obligated to report suspicious client activities related to money laundering.FundformeProgram adheres to the principles of Anti-Money Laundering and actively prevents any actions that aim to facilitate the process of legalizing illegally gained funds.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The process of money laundering involves converting illegally gained funds into other investments to conceal their source. It is done in three stages: placement, layering, and integration. FundformeProgram does not accept or pay cash under any circumstances to prevent money laundering. The company reserves the right to suspend any client’s operation that may be regarded as illegal or may be related to money laundering in the opinion of its staff.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>To ensure compliance with applicable law and regulations issued by monetary authorities, FundformeProgram verifies the identity of each client or legal entity through a KYC procedure. It also applies heightened scrutiny to clients who are residents of countries with inadequate AML standards or that represent a high risk for crime and corruption.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>To verify personal information, clients provide full name, date of birth, country of origin, and complete residential address. The required documents include a current valid passport, driving license, national identity card, and documents proving the current permanent address.
